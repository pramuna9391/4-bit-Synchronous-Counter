# 4-bit-Synchronous-Counter
A 4-bit synchronous counter is a digital circuit used to count from 0 to 15 (2⁴ − 1) in binary, with all the flip-flops triggered simultaneously by the same clock signal. It's called "synchronous" because all flip-flops update at the same time with each clock pulse.
# Key Concepts
Bit size: 4-bit means it can represent 2⁴ = 16 states (from 0000 to 1111 in binary).
Clock: A single clock signal is applied to all flip-flops simultaneously.
Flip-flops: Typically uses JK or T flip-flops, or D flip-flops with combinational logic.
Modulus: A 4-bit counter is a mod-16 counter.
Applications: Timers, frequency dividers, digital clocks, memory addressing, etc.
# Working Principle
In a synchronous binary counter, every flip-flop toggles according to the logic condition built from the outputs of the previous flip-flops.
